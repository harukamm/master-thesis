\chapter*{Abstract}

We present OCaml Blockly, OCaml visual programming editor based on Blockly.
Blockly is a JavaScript library for creating visual block programming languages.
Blockly makes it impossible to cause a syntax error since constructed set of blocks always represents an abstract syntax tree.
However, Blockly does not deal with semantic errors, so it allows users to create a program which does not compile.

OCaml Blockly provides UI which prevents users from constructing blocks with any compile errors.
Blocks in OCaml Blockly change their colors and shapes using their data types inferred by its Hindleyâ€“Milner type system.
OCaml Blockly visually represents information of variables such as their types, bindings, and scopes.
Additionally, we support bidirectional converters between OCaml code and blocks in OCaml Blockly.
It helps beginners get used to text-based coding.
We show the design and implementation of OCaml Blockly and discuss future tasks toward practical uses.
